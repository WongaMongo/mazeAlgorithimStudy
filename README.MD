# C++ Algorithm Studies 

Just some study to try and explore some algorithims through c++. 
Probably starting on informed then to uninformed.

## To-Do list (So far)

Convert image to data that the program can read.

Convert data back into an image. 

Draw on image/change color

Make up an algorithm to get from point A to point B
